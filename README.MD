# GitHub Project Search CLI Tool

The aim of the project is to create a CLI tool "apply all the search criteria from the GitHub global search and just spit out results in YAML or whatever".

The project idea is somewhat a personal challenge, since I know nothing of golang
and it'll be a good portfolio project.

Inspired by [rwxrob's wish list ideas](https://github.com/rwxrob/wish/tree/main/20210627143159).
